## Application Suitability

The Fitness Goal Tracker is well-suited for a microservices architecture due to the following reasons:

1. **Modular Functionality**: The application has distinct functionalities (user management, activity tracking, and managing group workout sessions) that can be developed independently.

2. **Scalability**: Different components may experience varying loads and thus require independent scaling.

3. **Technology Diversity**: Using different technologies like Python (Flask framework) and Node.js allows for choosing the best tool for each service.

4. **Future Extensibility**: It is easier to add new features and integrate external services like nutrition APIs.

Examples of similar applications:

- **Goals.Fit**: This mobile app adds ranking and leaderboards based on the fitness goals achieved.

- **Muscle Monster Workout Planner**: Shows statistics and future trends based on the fitness activity.

## Service Boundaries and Architecture

We intend to use two microservices and an API Gateway:

1. **User Service**: Manages user accounts, goals, and profiles.
2. **Activity Tracking Service**: Handles workout sessions, calorie calculations, and statistics.
3. **API Gateway**: Routes requests, manages WebSocket connections, and handles load balancing.

To ensure **Service High Availability**, each service will have multiple instances running, and the API Gateway will distribute the requests among them. This setup enhances fault tolerance and allows for scaling.

We will also implement a **Circuit Breaker** in the API Gateway that trips if multiple reroutes happen or if a service consistently fails to respond.

## System Architecture Diagram

Key features to develop:

- **WebSockets**: Implement group sessions and develop a voting system.
- **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests using pytest for Python services and Jest for the Node.js API Gateway.
- **Circuit Breaker**: Use a circuit breaker library in the API Gateway, configured to log failures and trip if multiple reroutes or errors occur within a specified time frame.
- **Service High Availability**: Run multiple instances of each service and implement load balancing via the API Gateway.
- **Cache High Availability**: Implement cache sharding and replication in Redis to ensure high availability and scalability.
- **Database Replication and Failover**: Implement database redundancy for at least one database with a minimum of three replicas to ensure data availability and failover capabilities.
- **Data Warehouse and ETL**: Create a data warehouse that is periodically updated with all data from the databases using an ETL process.

## Technology Stack

1. **User Service**

   - **Language**: Python
   - **Framework**: Flask
   - **Database**: SQLite3 (primary), replicated with three nodes for redundancy and failover.

     We use SQLite3 as it is a relational database, suitable for structured user data. We implement database replication to ensure high availability and data redundancy.

2. **Activity Tracking Service**

   - **Language**: Python
   - **Framework**: Flask
   - **Database**: MongoDB (primary), configured with replication and sharding for scalability and high availability.

     We use MongoDB as it is a NoSQL database, ideal for storing varied workout data. Its flexible schema allows for easy addition of new types of activities/metrics. Replication and sharding are implemented for high availability and scalability.

3. **API Gateway**

   - **Language**: Node.js
   - **Load Balancing**: The API Gateway distributes incoming requests to multiple instances of each service.
   - **Circuit Breaker**: Use a circuit breaker configured to log failures and trip if multiple reroutes or errors occur within a specified time frame.

4. **Shared Cache**

   - **Technology**: Redis
   - **Features**: Cache sharding, consistent hashing, and high availability.

     Redis is used as a shared cache between services. We implement consistent hashing for cache distribution and replication for high availability. Sharding is used to scale the cache horizontally.

5. **Communication Patterns**

   - **gRPC**: For inter-service communication.
   - **WebSockets**: For real-time features like live chat, group sessions, and sending immediate alerts when a goal is achieved.
   - **RESTful APIs**: For client-server communication.

6. **Logging and Monitoring**

   - **ELK Stack**: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana are used for centralized logging, monitoring, and visualization.

     - **Elasticsearch**: Stores logs and provides search capabilities.
     - **Logstash**: Collects, processes, and forwards logs to Elasticsearch. We will use a simple input-filter-output.
     - **Kibana**: Visualizes the logs and metrics from Elasticsearch.

7. **Data Warehouse and ETL**

   - **ETL Process**: Extracts data from the services' databases, transforms it as needed, and loads it into a centralized data warehouse for analytics.
   - **Data Warehouse**: Used to store historical data for reporting and analytics purposes.

     We might use a scheduled job or a separate service to perform ETL operations. For example, a Python script that runs daily to extract data from MongoDB and SQLite3, transform it, and load it into a PostgreSQL data warehouse.

   - Example ETL Process:
     - Extract: Pull user and activity data from MongoDB and SQLite3.
     - Transform: Clean and aggregate data, such as calculating total calories burned per user.
     - Load: Insert the transformed data into the data warehouse

8. Long-Running Saga Transactions with Coordinator

   In a microservices setup, handling transactions across multiple services can be challenging. Instead of using a traditional 2-Phase Commit, which is complex and can block other operations, we use a **Saga pattern** with a **coordinator**.

   - The coordinator oversees and sequences operations across different services, ensuring that each part of a transaction completes successfully or is rolled back if an error occurs.
   - If an operation fails, the coordinator triggers "compensating actions" (undo actions) for previously completed steps, maintaining consistency across services.

   **A possible example**:

   - **User Sets a Goal**: The User Service updates the user profile with the new fitness goal.
   - **Activity Tracking**: The Activity Service is notified of this new goal to adjust activity suggestions.
   - **Error Handling**: If either of these steps fails, the coordinator ensures previous steps are undone or adjusted as needed.

9. **Containerization**

   - **Docker**: For containerizing all services and components.
   - **Docker Compose**: For local development and testing, orchestrating multiple containers.

### WebSocket Events

Group sessions will use WebSockets for real-time interaction:

- **Session Creation**: A user creates a session, which is stored in Redis with a unique session ID.
- **Joining**: Other users join the session using this ID, creating WebSocket connections.
- **Real-time Updates**: All session activities (user joins, leaves, exercise updates) are broadcasted to all participants.
- **Data Persistence**: At the end of the session, data is saved to the Activity Tracking Service's MongoDB database.
